--> Optimize the ray sorter

--> Expand the expr parser, where you have to include
	-- declaration nodes (done)
	-- assignment nodes (assignment done, but comparison is still remaining)
	-- maths and boolean expression nodes (done)

You will expand the ExprParser, and the first part of the 
parser will be finished

--> Write a semantic analyser and the frontend is done!

--> Needs a new sampling strategy
