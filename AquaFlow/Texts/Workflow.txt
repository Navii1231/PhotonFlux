Currently: testing the deferred and shading pipelines

Ideas and Suggestions: 
--> We could store all the renderables in one place, and copy them into the
	GPU memory all at once when required

Implementation:
--> Writing a generic deferred pipeline (deferred pipeline and shading pipeline; done)
--> Incorporating different kinds of shading models (material system class)
--> Generating a fragment shader and a deferred pipeline 
	corresponding to a shading model (shader generator class)

--> Writing generic material system
	
	" The materials often consist of uniquely named parameters
	* tuned out and set by the artists. Thus, we need a way to 
	* access those random parameters from the material
	* by their names. Furthermore, a material also contains 
	* a shader often found in terms of graph or a tree. The shader determines 
	* how those parameters are used and what resources 
	* are required in shading the model. In other words, 
	* we want a material system which can translate this graph into a 
	* parameterized shader that we can run on the GPU" -- From AquaFlow\Include\Geometry3D\Geometry3D.h

--> The MaterialSystem class can read a node graph, a material file, or a hand-written shader
	and it can generate MaterialInstance class that will hold the shading logic (the rasterization 
	and ray tracing pipelines) as well as the node graph and the shader parameters
	
--> Including compute pipelines for shading stage of deferred rendering
	which will allow us to run arbitrary materials on the GPU

--> Writing a generic shader generator and that can produce both fragment and compute
	shaders corresponding the shading model and material graph. It will also be able
	determine information regarding resources used in the material graph, which will 
	help us generating them as well as create the form the deferred pipeline

--> Implementing GPU BVH builder


--> Optimize the ray sorter


--> Expand the expr parser, where you have to include
	-- declaration nodes; done
	-- assignment nodes (assignment: done, but comparison is still remaining)
	-- maths and boolean expression nodes; done

ExprParser, right now, does not account for all kinds for exprs.
You will expand the ExprParser, and the first part of the 
parser will be finished

--> Write a semantic analyser and the frontend is done!

--> Needs a new sampling strategy
